# Fractal View
## About the project
This is my final project for the computer graphics lecture. It uses the provided template.

I implemented a raymarching engine for displaying the mandelbulb and a set of julia fractals. There is an option to export the viewport as png. You also have the option to change between five different performance settings. The performance settings controll the renderresolution of the canvas. That means, that they also controll the resolution of the exported png.

## How to use it
Start the index.html on a server.
