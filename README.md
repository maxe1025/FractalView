# FractalView

## About the project
This is my final project for the computer graphics lecture. It is based on the provided template.

The application supports visualizing both the **Mandelbulb** and **Julia fractals**. Additional features include:

- Camera navigation (orbit and zoom)
- Adjustable fractal power
- Orbit animation
- Export of the viewport as png
- Four performance levels, affecting canvas resolution and export quality

## How to use it
Start the index.html on a server. I tested the applocation using the Live Server extension for VS Code.
